# H22CityExpoHackathon
Explore Helsingborg City's Open API and Open Data to improve the quality of life of citizens

## Helsingborg City Open Data
https://helsingborg.io/dataportal/

## Python

create new environment for project (one time setup), also makesure kernel from new environment is available from Juputer Lab
```
conda create --name h22
conda activate h22
conda install pip
conda install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name h22 --display-name "Python 3 (h22)"
```

only when conda needs update
```
conda update -n base conda
```

install GeoPandas in h22 environment
```
conda install -c conda-forge geopandas
```
install streamlit
```
pip install streamlit
```
install folium
```
pip install folium

## Event Details:
Hackathon-improving the quality of life of citizens
### Do you have an idea for how the everyday life of Helsingborger’s can be improved with the help of digital tools?

 In 2020, the city of Helsingborg had over 34,000 cases that handled reports concerning operation and maintenance. This can apply to everything from questions about snow removal to why there is no road bump at the school in the area. With the help of the app "A better HBG", we have given the citizen the opportunity to come with suggestions and questions, in order to make it easier for the city to quickly handle and provide direct feedback on the cases that come in. It has provided good support, but we see room for improvement.

 This is just one example of how digital solutions should make it easier for citizens to be able to swiftly report problems and solutions to us. Maybe you have a suggestion on how everyday life can be improved for everyone who works and lives in Helsingborg with the help of smart and digital solutions?

 

### You are not alone - Develop your idea together with others

During a 2½-day hackathon at HETCH in the Prisma House down in Oceanhamnen, we challenge ourselves to develop new ideas with the goal of improving the everyday lives of Helsingborger’s. Together with other talented developers, we are investing in finding new solutions with a focus on digital sustainability and quality of life, but above all we will have a lot of fun.

 The main theme is "How can we make it easy for residents to improve their immediate environment?" but you are welcome to come up with your own suggestions.

 ### Create your vision with the help of open data and the city's innovation work

 You will not start with two empty hands. During the days of the hackathon, you will be able to use the city's open data and be inspired by our innovation work to find ways to how we can create a better city for every citizen. We know that you have ideas about combining functionality with data into something that inspires, provides value and makes certain things a little easier.

Come and refine your thought with us!
